Maze Terrain for final game design project
Terrain is a maze in which the player is dropped into that gets more barren as the maze goes on.  There are dead ends, multiple ways to navigate, and many wrong ways.
At the end of the maze is a safe haven for the player with a white light leading to who knows where!
